/*
Prateek Bhayia likes to play with bits. One day Prateek bhayia decides to assign a task to his student Sanya. 
You have help Sanya to complete this task. Task is as follows - 
Prateek Bhayia gives Q queries each query containing two integers a and b. 
Your task is to count the no of set-bits in for all numbers between a and b (both inclusive)

//The given soltion to the above question is brute force TC:O(n*log(n)) {log(n) is basically the number of bits}
