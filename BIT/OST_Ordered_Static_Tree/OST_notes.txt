What is an Order Statistic Tree?

An OST allows you to:
1) Insert an element.
2) Delete an element.
3) Find the k-th smallest element.
4) Find the rank of an element (i.e., how many elements ≤ that value).

Can we do this with BIT?

Yes, if:
1) The values inserted are positive integers within a reasonable range (like ≤ 10⁶).
2) If not, we can use coordinate compression.

We treat the BIT like a frequency array, where:
1) BIT[i] = number of times value i has been inserted.
2) The prefix_sum(i) = count of all numbers ≤ i.
